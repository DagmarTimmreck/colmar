Workflow:

- basic setup (html/css/resources/git repo)
- html: add content and structure semantically
- css: layout page for mobile

- css: make page responsive
- test on different browsers
- test on tablet & mobile
- design decisions:
  - colors
  - fonts
  - interactive elements/transitions
  - icons
  (git: branch for alternative design decisions?)
- assets:
  - optimize images
  - favicon
- test on different browsers and devices
- use keyboard to see focused elements

In every step:
- work from top to bottom

After every step:
- validate html
- test usability (aria?)
- optimize for speed
- clean up code
- add comments
- write summary in README

Parts of the design process that are still missing:
- layout a page and create a mock
- plan for multipage experiences
